**Ahead-of-Time (AOT)** and **Just-in-Time (JIT)** are two different compilation techniques used in programming.

**AOT Compilation**:
- AOT is a process of compiling higher-level language or intermediate language into a native machine code, which is system dependent.
- In simple words, when you serve/build your application, the AOT compiler converts your code during the build time before your browser downloads and runs that code.
- When you are using AOT Compiler, compilation only happens once, while you build your project.
- The browser does not need to compile the code in runtime, it can directly render the application immediately, without waiting to compile the app first so, it provides quicker component rendering.
- AOT provides better security. It compiles HTML components and templates into JavaScript files long before they are served into the client display.

**JIT Compilation**:
- JIT is a compilation technique that compiles the application’s templates and components during runtime, right in the client’s browser.
- Unlike AOT compilation, which occurs before the application is loaded, JIT compilation happens on-the-fly as the application is launched.

The key difference between AOT and JIT is when the compilation happens. With AOT, your code is compiled beforehand. With JIT, your code is compiled at runtime in the browser. Both compile your code, so it can run in a native environment (aka the browser).
